# Setup of a Dell Boomi Molecule with multiple nodes on Kubernetes

![Setup](resources/k8s-boomi-molecule.png)

## Prerequisites

This document explains the steps for nfs Persistent volume. You might want to use another type of PV (Azure File, GlusterFS, Vsphere volume, Portworx volumes, ScaleIO volumes, etc) but make sure that:

1. the volume supports file locking 

2. the mount path on all the nodes will be the same

3. you have the libraries or tools installed on the Workers.

   For instance, with nfs, make sure that your workers (each of them) will have access to net-tools and nfs-utils:


```
yum install -y net-tools nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib
```

## Deployment of nfs Persistent Volume

![](resources/dashboard-welcome.png)

Make sure you are on "default" Namespace.

Click on “+Create” then “Create from file” and upload “nfs-volume.yaml” [here](molecule/nfs-volume.yaml?raw=true) - make sure that you update the file (replace value starting with @@@@)

Validate that the Persistent Volume Claims is added

## Deployment of Boomi Molecule on Kubernetes

Make sure you are on "default" Namepace.

Click on “+Create” then “Create from fileand upload "boomi-molecule.yaml" [here](molecule/boomi-molecule.yaml?raw=true) - make sure that you update the file (replace value starting with @@@@)

You will see the new deployment with 1 Pod requested:

Refresh the screen

Check the content of the NFS location and the content of hosts.log

```
nas_server# ll

```

```
nas_server# cat hosts.log

```


Connect to AtomSphere and check that you have a new element

![](resources/atomsphere_unattached.png)

Wait for few minutes and you will see the Atom up

![](resources/atomsphere_unattached_connected.png)

If the Atom/Molecule doesn't appear or if bullet remains gray, please check the logs Kubernetes and also the logs contained in the Shared Folder, you should have something similar:

```
nas_server# cat Molecule_centos_kubernetes/install_Molecule_centos_kubernetes.log

# Scaling of Boomi Molecule on Kubernetes

## Static Scaling

Return to Kubernetes Dashboard and select "Deployments" option:

![](resources/dashboard-deployment-scale-welcome.png)

Select the right menu and "Scale"

![](resources/dashboard-deployment-scale-scale.png)

Change the number of desired pods to 3

![](resources/dashboard-deployment-scale-scale3.png)

![](resources/dashboard-deployment-scale-scale3-pending.png)

![](resources/dashboard-deployment-done.png)

After 1 minute or two, go back AtomSphere and check the Cluster Status

![](resources/atomsphere_cluster3.png)

## Auto-scaling based on CPU Load

For auto-scaling based on CPU Load (for instance 25%), connect to your Kubernetes master and run the following command:

```
kubectl autoscale deployment molecule-deployment --cpu-percent=25 --min=1 --max=3
```

# Deployment of Dummy API and test of Load Balancing

Change the type of API Type to Advanced.

Deploy one of your API (REST or SOAP) on the environment:

![](resources/atomsphere_deployment.png)



Then test your API with your Browser/SOAPUI or Postman using the following URI:

<http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/http:molecule-service:9090/proxy/>\<API Resource Path\>

![](resources/postman-test.png)

Run as many calls as the number of Pods:

![](resources/atomsphere-postman-calls.png)

View the extended information for each call, and validate that the Node ID is changing for each call:

![](resources/atomspheremenu-extended-info.png)

-   Extended Execution Information for 1st call: **Node ID kubeworker3**

-   Extended Execution Information for 2nd call: **Node ID kubeworker2**

-   Extended Execution Information for 3rd call: **Node ID kubeworker1**
